      <p>Welcome to our TSA Timer web application! We're proud to offer you a comprehensive solution to all your airport security checkpoint timing needs. Our application uses a wide variety of technologies, including MySQL, Java Springboot, Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and SQL as our database to bring you the best possible experience.</p>

      <h3>How It Works</h3>
      <p>At its core, our application is designed to give you accurate wait times for various TSA checkpoints at airports all over the world. Our system works by collecting data from users who enter their wait times when they enter and exit a security checkpoint. We then use this data to calculate an average wait time, which is displayed to other users who are searching for the same information.</p>

      <h3>How To Use It</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Select the airport you're interested in from the dropdown menu.</li>
        <li>Enter the date and time of your flight.</li>
        <li>Select the TSA checkpoint you'll be using.</li>
        <li>Our system will display the average wait time for that checkpoint, based on data from other users.</li>
        <li>Use this information to plan your arrival time at the airport.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Why Use It</h3>
      <p>We're proud to offer you the most accurate, up-to-date information about TSA checkpoint wait times available anywhere. Whether you're a seasoned traveler or someone who's just getting started, we're confident that our application will make your airport experience smoother, faster, and more efficient than ever before.</p>
